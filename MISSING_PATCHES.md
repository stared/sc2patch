   - HTML: Uses `<dl><dd>` nested structure (definition lists)
   - Status: ⚠️ Would require additional scraper logic

4. **3.3.0 BU** (2016-05-23)
   - Official URL: http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/20118421/ (redirects to homepage)

## Summary

**Current Status: 40 patches in visualization** (was 37, +2 from Liquipedia, +1 empty file)

**Investigation Results:**
- ✅ **3 patches verified NO balance changes** (5.0.10, 4.8.3, 3.9.1)
- ✅ **2 Balance Updates recovered via Liquipedia scraping** (5.0.2 BU, 4.10.1 BU) - 16 changes total
- ⚠️ **2 Balance Updates with complex HTML** (3.3.2 BU, 3.3.0 BU) - ~8 changes total, would need enhanced scraper
- ⚠️ **2 patches not yet verified** (4.11.4 BU, 3.1.1 BU)

**Liquipedia Scraper:**
- ✅ Created `scripts/scrape_liquipedia_patches.py`
- ✅ Handles 2 HTML formats: nested `<ul><li><b>` and direct `<li><a>`
- ⚠️ Does not handle `<dl><dd>` definition list format (3.3.2 BU uses this)

**Next Steps (Optional):**
1. Enhance scraper to handle `<dl><dd>` format for 3.3.2 BU (~2 changes)
2. Investigate why 3.3.0 BU section wasn't found (~6 changes)
3. Verify 4.11.4 BU and 3.1.1 BU

**Recommendation:** Current 39 patches with changes (40 total - 1 empty) provide excellent coverage. The 2 remaining Balance Updates (3.3.2 BU, 3.3.0 BU) are minor hotfixes with ~8 total changes. Cost/benefit of enhancing scraper is low. Focus on other priorities.
