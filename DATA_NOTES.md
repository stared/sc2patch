# Data Notes

## Patch Coverage

This visualization includes **release patches only** (live game balance changes).

### What's Included

| Era | Expansion Launch | Patch Range | First Balance Patch |
|-----|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Wings of Liberty** (WoL) | Jul 27, 2010 | 1.1.0 - 1.5.4 | Sep 2010 (1.1.0) |
| **Heart of the Swarm** (HotS) | Mar 12, 2013 | 2.0.8 - 2.1.9 | May 2013 (2.0.8) |
| **Legacy of the Void** (LotV) | Nov 10, 2015 | 3.1.1 - 3.14.0 | Jan 2016 (3.1.1) |
| **Free-to-Play Era** (F2P) | Nov 14, 2017 | 4.0 - 4.12.0 | Nov 2017 (4.0) |
| **10th Anniversary** | Jul 2020 | 5.0.2 - 5.0.15 | Aug 2020 (5.0.2) |

**Total: 49 release patches** with balance changes

Note: First balance patches often arrived 1-3 months after expansion launches.

### What's Excluded

#### Beta Patches (~39 total)
| Era | Patches | Versions | Notes |
|-----|---------|----------|-------|
| WoL Beta | ~18 | 0.3.0 - 0.20.0 | Before Jul 2010 release |
| HotS Beta | ~15 | Balance Updates #1-15 | Before Mar 2013 release |
| LotV Beta | ~6 | 2.5.0 - 2.5.5 | Before Nov 2015 release |

**Why excluded:**
- Beta patches show design iteration, not live balance
- Changes were frequent and drastic (multiple per week)
- Some units had completely different mechanics (e.g., Disruptor in 2.5.x)
- Historical Blizzard URLs may no longer exist

### Unit-Specific Notes

#### Units Introduced in LotV (Nov 2015)
These units appear in our data starting from their first **live** balance change, not their introduction:
- **Disruptor** - First live balance change: Patch 4.0 (Nov 2017) - verified against Blizzard source
- **Adept**, **Liberator**, **Ravager**, **Lurker** (reintroduced) - first changes vary

Note: Liquipedia shows beta patch history (2.5.x series) for these units which we don't include. The Disruptor had no balance changes in 3.x patches (Nov 2015 - Nov 2017) despite being playable.
